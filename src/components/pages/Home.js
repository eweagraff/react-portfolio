      <p>
        Hi, my name is Emily. I have been learning to code for the last two
        months. So far, I have learned the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I
        am enjoying learning a new and valuable skill to help me change career
        paths. In my free time I love being outside and enjoying my plants on
        the porch!
