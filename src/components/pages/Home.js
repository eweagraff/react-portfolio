        Full stack web developer that has a passion for an aesthetically pleasing
        design. I recently graduated from UC Davis Full Stack Coding Boot Camp.
        The boot camp required 240 in-class hours and helped build a strong
        foundation in web development. Part of the course completion included
        building three web applications working collaboratively with a group.
        Some of my newly developed skills include HTML/CSS, Javascript/JQuery,
        responsive design, bootstrap, semantic UI, React.js, API interaction,
        mongoDB and MySQL.
      </p>
      <p>My most recent project included utilizing React.js to
        build a single-page web application that allowed users to search
        National Parks, save them to a wishlist and then view them on a map. The
        user was also required to sign up or login to search and save. As a
        group, we shared ideas and worked as a team to complete this application
        by utilizing Github. I am looking forward to enhancing my skill set with
        a highly-driven team in developing skillfully designed web applications.</p>
